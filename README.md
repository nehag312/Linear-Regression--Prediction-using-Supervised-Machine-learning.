# TSF-task-1
Supervised machine leanring.
This is a simple linear regression task involving only two variables. The dependent variable is "marks" and the independent variable is "study hours".
I have used the "lm" function to fit a linear model between the variables and also represented the fitted line in the scatter plot of original dataset.
